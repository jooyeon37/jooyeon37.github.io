  Hi, I'm Jooyeon Jeong. My research in digital semiconductor design focuses on optimizing PPA(Power, Performance, Area) in the physical design stage, including standard cell design optimization, chip layout optimization and design-technology co-optimization, which considers both standard cells and chip layouts simultaneously. In my remaining time before graduation, I plan to advance my research by applying AI to improve.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Algorithm</mark>, <mark>Optimization</mark> and <mark>Electronic Design Automation</mark>
